# Credit Card Approval System

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning system for predicting credit card approval based on applicant data. The system includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation, showcasing a complete machine learning pipeline.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and scales numerical features.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluates model performance using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/abhinavsaurabh/Credit-Card-Approval-System.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Credit-Card-Approval-System
   ```
3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook Enhanced_Credit_Approval_System.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Project Structure
- `Enhanced_Credit_Approval_System.ipynb`: The main notebook containing the complete pipeline.
- `README.md`: Detailed documentation of the project.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies required for running the project.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes anonymized applicant information such as age, income, credit history, etc. Please ensure the dataset is in the root directory of the project before running the notebook.

## Results
- The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of **90%** and an AUC of **0.95**.
- Detailed evaluation results and visualizations are available in the notebook.
